Fault list generation approach: For each register(153) injections are perfomed in 18 threads(out of the 512 used by kernels) testing a pseudo-random single bit stuck at 1 and stuck at 0.

Fault attributes legend: faults are classified as 
- SDC-safe if the injected fault still make the Neural Network produce the correct guess with a different percentage(in each of the guessing classes) with respect to fault-free result;
- SDC-critical if the final guess is wrong;
- Masked if the fault doesn't affect the guess and the associated percentage neither;
- DUE if a segmentation fault occurs and the result is not obtained at all
